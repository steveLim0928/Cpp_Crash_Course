/* 
When creating functions there is a precaution that is often considered a 'best practice'.

When passing variables that are not going to be modified in the function, define the variable as a 'const' so that it cannot be changed by the function.

int doubleInput(const int input)
int doubleInput(const int input)
{
    int h = input *2;
    return h;
}
